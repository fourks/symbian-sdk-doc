<h1>Introduction to threads and processes</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Programs consist of a number of processes, each of which contains one
or more conceptually concurrent threads of execution.</p>
<p>A thread is the unit of execution within a process. Every time a
process is initialised, a primary thread is created. For many applications the
primary thread is the only one that the application requires; however,
processes can create additional threads.</p>
<p>Each user process has its own private address space, i.e. a
collection of memory regions which that process can access. A user process
cannot directly address memory areas in the address space of another process.
There is also a special process, the Kernel process, whose threads run at
supervisor privilege level. This process normally contains two threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the Kernel server thread, which is the initial thread whose
execution begins at the reset vector, and which is used to implement all Kernel
functions requiring allocation or deallocation on the Kernel heap. This is the
highest priority thread in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the null thread, which runs only when no other threads are ready
to run. The null thread places the processor into idle mode to save
power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Threads execute individually and are unaware of other threads in a
process. The scheduling of threads is pre-emptive, i.e. a currently executing
thread may be suspended at any time to allow another thread to run. </p>
<p>Each thread is assigned a priority; at any time, the thread running
is the highest priority thread which is ready to run. Threads with equal
priority are time-sliced on a round-robin basis. Context switching between
threads involves saving and restoring the state of threads. This state includes
not only the processor registers (the thread context) but also the address
space accessible to the thread (the process context). The process context only
needs switching if a reschedule is between threads in different
processes.</p>
<p>Compare this with active objects which allow non pre-emptive
multi-tasking within a single thread.</p>
<p>A thread can suspend, resume, panic and kill another thread.</p>
<p>When a thread is created it is put into a suspended state, it does
not begin to run until that thread&#8217;s <code>Resume()</code> member
function is called.</p>
<p>When a thread is created, it is given the priority
<code>EPriorityNormal</code> by default. The fact that a thread is initially
put into a suspended state means that the thread priority can be changed
(RThread::SetPriority()) before the thread is started
(RThread::Resume()).</p>
