<h1>The control stack</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The control stack is a mechanism provided by the control framework
for handling key press events. The window server, which generates events for
control framework applications, channels all key press events to the
application that currently has keyboard focus. (Strictly speaking, it channels
key press events to the <em>window group</em> that
currently has keyboard focus, but since, in the control framework, there is one
window group per application, these can be thought of as equivalent.) It is up
to the application itself to channel the event to the correct destination: the
window server does not associate a key press event with a particular
control.</p>
<p>In control framework applications using the <em>standard
app UI</em>, the control stack contains a list of controls which
wish to receive keyboard events. Controls are added to the stack using
<code>CCoeAppUi::AddToStackL()</code>, and their ordering on the stack
determines their priority in receiving key events: the one with the lowest
position on the stack is offered key events first. When a key press event
occurs, it is offered to each control on the stack in turn until it is consumed
(i.e. used by that control).</p>
<p>The ordering of controls on the stack is determined by their
priority, a value passed to <code>CCoeAppUi::AddToStackL()</code>. If several
controls on the stack have the same priority, their ordering is determined by
the order in which they were added to the stack. The diagram below shows a
hypothetical stack containing 4 controls added in the following order: control
A (priority 50 — used for dialogs), control B (priority 10 — used for
menus), control C (priority 0 — used for application views), control D
(priority 50).</p>
<div class="Figure">
<p class="Image"><img src="cointro-stack.gif" alt="Example showing the order and priority o..."  border="0"></p>
<p class="Caption">Example showing the order and priority of controls on the
control stack</p>
</div>
<p>On the stack shown in the diagram, key press events will be offered
first to control D, followed by A, B and C in that order. A control on the
stack can refuse key press events by setting a flag: typically this is done,
for example, by dialogs when they are not visible.</p>
<p>Applications use the control stack to channel key press events to
destinations in decreasing order of priority, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>debug keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any active dialog</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any menu bar (i.e., its
<em>hot-keys</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the application view</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these are not implemented as controls within the control
framework (because it provides no concrete controls), Uikon implements controls
for debug keys, dialogs and menu bars, and adds them to the control stack.
Applications typically implement an application view and in turn add this to
the stack. In Uikon applications, debug keys have the highest priority on the
stack, so that they are always offered key events first. A key event that is
not a debug key is then passed on as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if a dialog is active, it is offered to the dialog: while a
dialog is active, no menus can be displayed, and no keys go through to the
application view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if no dialog is active, it is offered first to the menu bar as a
<em>hot-key</em>, and lastly to the application view
(assuming an application view has been added to the control stack).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within a dialog or an application view, the control stack does not
support keyboard focus. This is because the order of controls on the stack is
fixed for the duration they exist on the stack, which is normally the lifetime
of the application. Keyboard focus determines which visible control on the
screen receives key press events that have not already been consumed by
controls on the stack. Only one visible control at a time may have keyboard
focus, and the control which currently has focus may be changed by the
user.</p>
<p>The application view and any dialog in the application will typically
be compound controls containing a number of component controls. When either the
application view or a dialog receives a key press event, it is up to them to
channel the key event to the component that currently has keyboard
focus.</p>
