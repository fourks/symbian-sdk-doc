<h1>How to draw controls</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Controls are drawn using the drawing functions provided by a
<em>graphics context</em>, which is part of the window
server, not of the control framework itself. A graphics context can be obtained
using <code>CCoeEnv::SystemGc()</code>. This graphics context is used for most
drawing of controls, and is known as the <em>system graphics
context</em>.</p>
<p>There are two different circumstances in which controls are
drawn:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when the window server generates a redraw event, because the
contents of the control on the screen are no longer up-to-date: for example,
because another window, which was obscuring the control, has moved or
disappeared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the application requests the control to draw itself, either
because some application data has changed or because the control is appearing
on the screen for the first time</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Window server-initiated drawing (redraw events)</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Whenever the window server generates a redraw event, the control
framework function <code>HandleRedrawEvent()</code> is called. This calls
<code>Draw()</code>, a private virtual member function of
<code>CCoeControl</code>, which is implemented by each concrete control class
and draws the control on the screen.</p>
<p>Redraw events are generated for <i>windows</i>, not for
controls, so <code>HandleRedrawEvent()</code> is called on a window-owning
control, even if only one of its components requires a redraw. However, this
doesn't mean that all the components of the window-owning control are redrawn:
the redraw event contains a rectangle which indicates the area of the screen
that needs redrawing, and <code>HandleRedrawEvent()</code> calls
<code>Draw()</code> only on controls whose extent intersects the redaw
rectangle. The redraw rectangle is also passed to the control's
<code>Draw()</code> function, so that the control may redraw only the region
required.</p>
<p>When <code>HandleRedrawEvent()</code> calls <code>Draw()</code> on
a compound control, it also calls <code>Draw()</code> for all its
non-window-owning component controls, and all their components, recursively.
Unlike <code>DrawNow()</code>, <code>HandleRedrawEvent()</code> doesn't call
<code>Draw()</code> on components that are window-owning, because if they need
redrawing they will receive their own redraw event from the window
server.</p>

<h2>Application-initiated drawing</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Applications need to request a control to draw itself when either
some application data has changed or the control is appearing on the screen for
the first time. The way to do application-initiated drawing depends on whether
the whole control, or only part of the control, needs drawing.</p>
<a name="1.7.3"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Drawing an entire control</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>An application can request a control to draw the whole of itself
by calling either <code>CCoeControl::DrawNow()</code> or
<code>CCoeControl::DrawDeferred()</code>. <code>DrawNow()</code> calls the
control's <code>Draw()</code> function directly; <code>DrawDeferred()</code>
invalidates the area of screen containing the control, resulting in a window
server-initiated redraw. <code>DrawDeferred()</code> should be preferred in
those cases where the application may generate repeated draw events for a
control, not as a result of a user action. Note, however, that the preferred
programming style is to decouple changes in state from drawing actions.</p>
<p>When <code>DrawNow()</code> is called on a compound control, the
control framework also calls <code>DrawNow()</code> on all its component
controls (both non-window-owning and window-owning). Applications typically
call <code>DrawNow()</code> on their <em>top-level
control</em> when initialisation is complete, to cause the
application to be displayed.</p>
<a name="1.7.4"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Drawing part of a control</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>In some cases an application will need to draw only part of a
control in response to changes in application data. This is often the case if
the control displays a large amount of data, because a partial redraw reduces
processing and improves performance.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a word processor when the user deletes a
character from the end of a line. To draw the entire contents of the document
window the word processor must carry out extensive calculations to position
text on the screen, taking account of line-wrapping, tab positions, font sizes,
and so on. In the case of a character being deleted from the end of a line,
however, all that is required is to draw the area of the screen that was
occupied by the deleted character.</p>
<p>Assuming that the application view (in this case the word
processor&#8217;s document window) is implemented in the control framework as
a single control, the application program should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>implement member functions for drawing parts of the screen in
various granularities (e.g. a single character, a single line, a single
paragraph, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>call these functions, instead of <code>DrawNow()</code>, when
changes in application data occur</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these drawing functions must activate the graphics
context before it is drawn to, and deactivate it after drawing is
complete.</p>
