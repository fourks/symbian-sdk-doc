<h1>TCP/IP client programs</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>TCP/IP services are accessed through the sockets classes provided by
the Sockets Client API. The principal class is <code>RSocket</code>: this
interface encourages a particular type of application structure, which is
somewhat different from Windows or UNIX applications that use the standard
(BSD-style) sockets interface. </p>
<p>Instead of using blocking calls, the <code>RSocket</code> class
defines the functions for such operations as reading and writing data to be
asynchronous. This allows a program to run in a single thread and remain
responsive to other events. To take the example of a read operation, a typical
sequence is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An application makes a read request (for example with
<code>RSocket::Read()</code>), passing a reference to an empty buffer to the
socket server. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application continues with its processing, typically waiting
for and processing other events, such as user commands. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, the socket server monitors the socket for the
appropriate amount of data to be received. When this condition is met, it fills
the buffer and signals the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application’s event loop processes the event by calling the
appropriate handler — which in this case would usually read the data from the
buffer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An encapsulation of the event wait loop and handler despatcher is
provided in the active scheduler. The active scheduler requires that the
functions that make requests to a provider of asynchronous services, together
with a function that handles request completion, are encapsulated in an active
object class. Let’s imagine that we have written such an active object class,
<code>CRead</code>, derived from <code>CActive</code>, to wrap the read from
socket operation. It has a request function, <code>CRead::ReadRequest()</code>,
and implements the active object handler function, <code>RunL()</code>.</p>
<p>The sequence outlined above is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the handling of some previous event, the application
calls <code>CRead::ReadRequest()</code> to issue a read request. This function
makes the call to <code>RSocket::Read()</code>, passing a reference to an empty
buffer to the socket server. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control returns to the application’s active scheduler, which
waits for further events and calls the appropriate handlers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, the socket server monitors the socket for the
appropriate amount of data to be received. When this condition is met, it fills
the buffer and signals the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application’s active scheduler processes this event, and
calls the handler <code>CRead::RunL()</code>. This function reads the data from
the buffer, and takes other appropriate action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications usually define a number of active object classes in this
way to wrap each of their significant asynchronous socket operations: i.e.,
reading, writing, connection/shutdown, and asynchronous control operations.
</p>
<p>You will need to decide at design-time what active object classes
should wrap which sockets operations. The limiting factor is that an active
object can have only a single request active at any one time. This would mean,
for example, that wrapping read and write operations in a single class would
mean these requests could not be active in the same object at the same time. If
your application requires simultaneous read and write operations, you
could:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>wrap both operations in the same class, and have two objects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wrap each operation in a different class, and have an instance of
each</p>
</li>
</ul>
