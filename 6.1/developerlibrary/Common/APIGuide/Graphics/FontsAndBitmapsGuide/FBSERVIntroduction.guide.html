<h1>Introduction to Font and Bitmap Server</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The font and bitmap server manages fonts and bitmaps that may reside
in ROM or on some other drive. Bitmaps are stored in a shared-memory heap and
are directly accessible to all graphics programs, and the window server.
ROM-based fonts and bitmaps are used directly from ROM. File-based fonts and
bitmaps are loaded only once, and deleted from RAM when no longer needed by any
client.</p>
<p>The server manages sharing of fonts and bitmaps between all client
threads. It is conventional in that it is a single server to manage all these
system resources on behalf of all clients. There are two main motivations for
its presence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for fonts and bitmaps loaded from removable media into RAM, only
a single instance of each font or bitmap is loaded into RAM: a reference count
is maintained if multiple clients need to access it. The font or bitmap is
removed from RAM if the reference count reduces to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a standard technique for smooth animation is for a client program
to prepare an off-screen bitmap and then have the window server blit it to the
screen. The server manages all bitmaps in a single shared memory area
accessible to both the window server and its clients. The window server may
therefore efficiently blit a bitmap prepared by one of its clients, without
transferring the bitmap data itself between client and window server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The server is used to manage all fonts and bitmaps, including those
in ROM. </p>
<p>The server presents a conventional client API through
<code>RFbsSession</code>, representing a session from client to server. The
classes <code>CFbsFont</code> and <code>CFbsBitmap</code> (documented as parts
of the Fonts API and Bitmaps API respectively) represent client-side font and
bitmap classes.</p>
<p>The server is, however, slightly unusual in that the
<code>RFbsSession</code> is stored in client-side thread-local storage. The
constructors for <code>CFbsFont</code> and <code>CFbsBitmap</code> find this
session handle automatically: the client program does not have to pass it as a
parameter. Therefore, to most client programs, the client/server nature is
hidden from the API.</p>
<p>The <code>RFbsSession</code> is created for clients by the window
server’s client API when an window server session, <code>RWsSession</code>,
is constructed. A window server client is therefore always an Font and Bitmap
Server client.</p>
<p><code>RFbsSession</code> has a callback. When a resource is released
by a client, the API invokes the callback. In the (usual) case that the client
is a window server client, the window server’s client API handles the
callback by flushing its client-side buffer. The window server, as a
high-priority thread, then performs any drawing operations that might need the
font or bitmap. Only when this has completed does the server release the
resource. Without this mechanism, it would be possible for the server to
release a resource before it is required by the window server.</p>
