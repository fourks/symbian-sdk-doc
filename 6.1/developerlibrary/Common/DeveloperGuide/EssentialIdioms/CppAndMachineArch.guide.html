<h2>Overview</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The C++ language, following its foundation in C, is close to the
machine architecture. This allows applications to be implemented efficiently,
but, especially for developers new to the language, presents some issues of
which you need to be aware. This topic reviews the basic language features from
this perspective, and discusses how the resulting issues are handled.</p>

<h2>Arithmetic types</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>An <code>int</code> is usually implemented as the natural machine
word size of the particular implementation. This is 32 bits in most modern
machines. It was 16 bits in older machines, and in a few machines it may even
be 64 bits.</p>
<p>Similarly, a pointer (a <code>void*</code>, for instance) is
usually implemented as a machine word but, in some machines with special
architectures, a pointer may be more complex.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the Symbian platform is implemented on a machine
with a 32-bit or greater machine word, and 32-bit pointers. The types
<code>TInt</code> and <code>TUint</code> are <code>typedef</code>ed onto the
built-in <code>int</code> and <code>unsigned int</code> types, and are
guaranteed to be at least 32 bits.</p>
<p>When you need a specific size, regardless of implementation, use a
sized type. Several of these are available:</p><table cellpadding="1" border="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td
class="TableWrap"><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"
border="0"><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TInt32</code>, <code>TUint32</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>32-bit signed and unsigned integer</p>
<p>In each case, the representation is a 32-bit machine word
which, in the ARM architecture, must be aligned to a four-byte boundary. The
compiler ensures that this is always the case.</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TInt8</code>, <code>TUint8</code>,
<code>TText8</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>8-bit signed and unsigned integer, and 8-bit character</p>
<p>In each case, the representation is an 8-bit byte, which has
no specific alignment requirements.</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TInt16</code>, <code>TUint16</code>,
<code>TText16</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>16-bit signed and unsigned integer, and 16-bit
character</p>
<p>In each case, the representation is a 16-bit halfword, which
should be aligned to a two-byte boundary. The ARM architecture (prior to ARM8
and the Thumb instruction set) is relatively poor at handling 16-bit
quantities, and their use is recommended only when space is at a premium, or
for Unicode text handling.</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TInt64</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>64-bit unsigned integer</p>
<p>Since ARM has no built-in support for 64-bit arithmetic,
<code>TInt64</code> is implemented as a C++ class.</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TReal, TReal64</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>Double-precision floating point, IEEE754 64-bit
representation</p>
<p>This is the floating-point type recommended for general use.
The ARM architecture provides no native floating-point support. You are
recommended to perform operations in integer arithmetic if possible (for
instance, most GUI calculations), and to use floating-point only when the
problem demands it (for instance, a spreadsheet
application).</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="Cell">
<p><code>TReal32</code></p></td><td class="Cell">
<p>32-bit floating point</p>
<p>This is smaller and quicker, but should only be used when
space and/or time are at a true premium, as its precision is unsatisfactory for
many applications.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

<h2>Compound types</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Apart from classes, C++ inherits from C various other types of
compounding.</p>
<p>A <code>struct</code> maps an area of memory:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>struct TEg<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TInt iInt; // offset 0, 4 bytes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TText8 iText; // offset 4, 1 byte<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 3 wasted bytes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TReal iReal; // offset 8, 8 bytes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} // total length = 16 bytes</code></p>
<div class="Figure">
<p class="Image"><img src="idioms-struct.gif" alt=""  border="0"></p>
</div>
<p>Structures are regarded as <code>T</code> types: that is they may
not own heap-allocated resources such as <code>C</code> type classes. </p>
<p>An array contains many built-ins or other types</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>TInt a[32]; // 32 TInts, = 128 bytes</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>S b[3]; // 3 S&#8217;s, = 48 bytes</code></p>
<p>The main disadvantage of using C++ arrays is that there is no
automatic checking of index values. For this reason, and to support more
complex containers, C++ has evolved the Standard Template Library (STL). The
Symbian platform does not use STL, but provides its own range of efficient
container classes, for fixed, dynamic, and associative arrays. For details, see
<a href="../../APIGuide/Base/ArraysAndLists/DynamicArrays/DynamicArraysGuide1/index.html#DynamicArraysGuide1%2etoc">Dynamic Arrays</a>.</p>

<h2>Pointers</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>A pointer is a memory address. If you can take the address of an object,
then you can refer to it by pointer:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>S* ps; // pointer to an S</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>ps=&amp;s; // take address of existing S</code></p>
<p>A pointer is a 32-bit machine word, and could point to anything.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<p class="Image"><img src="idioms-pointer.gif" alt=""  border="0"></p>
</div>
<p>The specifier is placed next to the type rather than the name. </p>
<p>There is often a need to refer to memory as anything: for this, a
<code>void*</code> pointer is used in C++. In the Symbian platform, a
<code>TAny*</code> may be referred to instead. A <code>TAny*</code> is a
pointer to anything.</p>
<a name="1.7"></a>
</div><div class="Head2">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="97%"><tr valign="bottom"><td align="right"><p><a href="#_top"><img alt="[Top]" src="../../../_stock/arrow_up_2.gif" border="0"align="bottom"></a></p></td></tr></table><hr size="2" noshade>
<h2>Strings</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>In C++, the basic string is an array of characters:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>char* hello=&quot;hello&quot;;</code></p>
<p>This statement does two things: firstly, it sets aside six bytes of
memory containing the characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'. Secondly, it
sets the pointer <code>hello</code> to contain the address of the first of
those bytes.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<p class="Image"><img src="idioms-string.gif" alt=""  border="0"></p>
</div>
<p>Functions accessing the string rely on this address as its starting
point, and the terminating <code>\0</code> to indicate its end. Functions which
manipulate the string must either deliberately not extend it, or must have some
cue as to the amount of memory reserved for the string (beyond the trailing
<code>\0</code>) so they know how much it can be extended. This leads to an
awkward programming style, and every C++ library provides a way to manipulate
strings more elegantly. Symbian&#8217;s solution is
<em>descriptors</em>: these are introduced in
<a href="Descriptors.guide.html#idioms%2edescriptors">Descriptors</a>.</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="97%"><tr valign="bottom"><td align="right"><p><a href="#_top"><img alt="[Top]" src="../../../_stock/arrow_up_2.gif" border="0"align="bottom"></a></p></td></tr></table><hr size="2" noshade>
<h2>Functions</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Functions are a piece of code which can be called and executed from
anywhere else in a program. The stack is used to pass parameters and to contain
local variables. The stack is often augmented by machine registers, especially
in a register-rich processor such as the ARM, so that memory is often not used.
But, conceptually, there is a stack, and for the purposes of this explanation
it is convenient to consider the stack as if it were implemented entirely in
memory.</p>
<p>Parameters are passed by copying or evaluating onto the called
function&#8217;s stack frame. It is bad practice to pass large parameters,
such as an entire struct&nbsp;&#8212; or, in fact, anything beyond two
machine words in size&nbsp;&#8212; because this involves excessive copying.
Instead, a pointer or a reference should be used to pass the address, instead
of the data itself.</p>
<p>In a multi-tasking system such as the Symbian platform, each thread has
its own stack, which is a pre-allocated area of memory. Each function then
allocates its own frame from the stack on entry, and de-allocates it on exit.
The advantage of the stack mechanism is that allocation and de-allocation are
very rapid indeed&nbsp;&#8212; just a couple of instructions. Also, the
lifetime of any variable on the stack is very well defined: it is the lifetime
of its owning function&nbsp;&#8212; or, in fact, its owning block, since
functions may have blocks within them.</p>
<p>When a function returns, its stack memory is still there: it is just not
allocated. The stack memory will be re-used by the next function that is
called. A potential source of error is to allocate an object on a
function&#8217;s stack frame, and then return a pointer to it:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>TEg* foo()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEg s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEg* ps=&amp;s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ps; // !! error !!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>This pointer will not be valid for long, because the memory will be
re-used when the next function is called. You should never allow this to
happen. This error is so obvious that a compiler will trap it. But it can occur
in more subtle forms:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>foo(CContainer* aContainer)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEg s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEg* ps=&amp;s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aContainer-&gt;iMember=ps;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>These cannot be trapped so easily.</p>

<h2>Heap</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Each thread also has a heap. You can allocate and de-allocate objects on
the heap at will, and refer to them by pointer. The benefit of a heap is that
the lifetime of an object is entirely within your control. This power comes
with responsibility: you must not forget to de-allocate objects once you have
finished with them, and you must not use pointers to objects that have been
de-allocated. </p>
