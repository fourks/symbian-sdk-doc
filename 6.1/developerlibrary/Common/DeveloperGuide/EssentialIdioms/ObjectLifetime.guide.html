<h2>Overview</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>On both stack and heap, objects have a lifetime that runs
approximately as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>allocate memory for the object [on stack or heap]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>initialise: i.e., set the contents of that memory to usable
values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clean up: i.e., free up any other resources that might have
been used by that object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>de-allocate memory [from stack or heap]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Object lifetime is a fundamental concept. In some operating
systems, it can be neglected, because the stack and heap are destroyed when a
program terminates. On the Symbian platform, programs may run for months. It is
therefore important that objects be cleaned up as soon as their lifetime ends,
whether they are allocated on stack or heap, and whether their lifetime ended
through normal processing or through an error condition.</p>

<h2>Lifetimes in C</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>On the C stack, an object&#8217;s lifetime, for a user of that
object, might look like this:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>#include &quot;s.h&quot;</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void foo()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sInitialize(&amp;s, p1,p2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sUse(&amp;s, p3,p4);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sCleanup(&amp;s);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>Memory for the <code>S</code> is allocated on entry to the
function, and de-allocated on exit. The functions <code>sInitialize()</code>
and <code>sCleanup()</code> have been defined as part of the API for an
<code>S</code>, in <code class="filename">s.h</code> (in fact, C programmers are not always as
disciplined as this, and expect the users of their objects to do their own
initialisation, in an ad hoc way). The function <code>sUse()</code> represents
a use of the <code>S</code>. Note that the <code>S</code> is passed by pointer:
its address must be taken whenever it is used as a function parameter.</p>
<p>On the C heap, an object's lifetime might look like this:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void foo()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S* s=(S*)malloc(sizeof(S));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// should really check this succeeded!!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sInitialize(s, p1,p2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sUse(s, p3,p4);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sCleanup(s);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free(s);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>This time, a pointer is used to refer to the <code>S</code>: as a
result, the syntax of passing an <code>S</code> is slightly more pleasant,
because you don&#8217;t have to take its address.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the allocation and de-allocation of memory is
done using <code>malloc()</code>, whose syntax is extremely ugly, and
<code>free()</code>.</p>
<p>Mostly, the lifetime of a heap-based object would not be contained
within a single function like this: it might be created from one function, used
from another, and destroyed from another.</p>

<h2>Lifetimes in C++</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>One way of looking at C++ is as a neat way to control object lifetimes.
C++ allows functions to be associated directly with objects, which means that
you do not need a special naming convention to indicate that a function is
loosely associated with an object. Two special functions are the constructor
and the destructor: the constructor is called every time the C++ system knows
that an object&#8217;s lifetime begins, and the destructor is called every
time the C++ system knows that an object&#8217;s lifetime ends. Finally, C++
defines <code>operator new()</code>, which is much nicer than
<code>malloc()</code>, and <code>operator delete</code>, which is somewhat
nicer than <code>free()</code>.</p>
<p>On the C++ stack, an object&#8217;s lifetime looks like this:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void foo()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S s(p1,p2); // invokes constructor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s.Use(p3,p4); // nice syntax!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} // invokes destructor</code></p>
<p>Memory is allocated on function entry, and the constructor is invoked
when processing reaches the declaration. The use of member functions makes the
syntax of using everything much more pleasant: there is no need to pass a
reference to the <code>S</code>, because that is done implicitly.</p>
<p>Crucially, C++ causes the destructor to be invoked when the function
terminates. There is no need for the user of the class to do anything to cause
this to happen&nbsp;&#8212; all that&#8217;s necessary is that the provider
of the class provided a destructor.</p>
<p>Note, though, that in some exception conditions&nbsp;&#8212; for
instance, if the <code>Use()</code> function fails in some way&nbsp;&#8212;
the function may not return normally, and the destructor will therefore not be
invoked. We will shortly discuss how the Symbian platform addresses
this.</p>
<p>On the C++ heap, object lifetime looks like this:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void foo()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S* s=new S(p1,p2); // allocate, construct - should really check<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s-&gt;Use(p3,p4);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete s; // destruct, de-allocate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>Again, the syntax is much nicer. Only one thing cannot be provided by
C++: the user of a class must still remember to delete the object at the end of
its lifetime.</p>

<h2>Lifetimes in the Symbian platform</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Symbian platform idioms for object lifetime on the stack look very
similar to standard C++. The control of object lifetimes on the heap is,
however, very different, as shown in the following code:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void FooL()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CS* s=new (Eleave) CS; // allocate and check<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PushL(s); // push, just in case<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s-&gt;ConstructL(p1,p2);    // finish constructing - might leave<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s-&gt;UseL(p3,p4); // use - might leave<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy();    // destruct, de-allocate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>This code fragment shows four vital things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all heap-based classes have names beginning with <code>C</code>: they are
in fact derived from a single base class, <code>CBase</code>, which exists
solely to support easy cleanup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a cleanup stack is used to hold references to objects: if a leave occurs
due to out-of-memory or some other error, objects held on the cleanup stack are
popped from it, and destroyed. In the case of <code>CBase*</code> objects
pushed to the stack, they are destroyed by calling their C++ destructor. The
<code>CBase</code> class has a virtual destructor
(<code>CBase::~CBase()</code>) which makes this possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any function which might leave is designated by a trailing <code>L</code>
in its name. When you see a function that might leave, you must
<i>always</i> ask what would happen if it did leave, and what would
happen if it did not. The operating system provides all the program
infrastructure required to allow objects to be de-allocated even when a leave
occurs, but without burdening the programmer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>new (ELeave)</code> is an overloaded <code>operator new()</code>
function, which will leave if it fails to allocate the required memory. It
never returns a null pointer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two other things are worthy of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>since the cleanup stack itself requires memory allocation for each stack
frame, a push might leave. The <code>PushL()</code> function reflects this in
its name. The cleanup stack is guaranteed to have a free slot before a
<code>CleanupStack::PushL()</code>, so that the object reference will always be
successfully stored on the stack. If a leave occurs when allocating the next
stack frame, the object will be popped and destroyed as normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>the C++ constructor must not leave</i>. For objects whose
construction requires resource allocation or any other operation that might
fail, this means that construction must be separated into a C++ constructor
that does not leave, and another initialisation function that might leave,
which is conventionally called <code>ConstructL()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cleanup stack, <code>CBase</code>, and two-phase construction, are at
the heart of the operating system. A very few rules govern cleanup stack
programming, and they are relatively easy to learn. See
<a href="../../APIGuide/Base/MemoryManagement/CleanupSupport/CleanupSupportGuide2/index.html#CleanupSupportGuide2%2etoc">Cleanup Stack Basics</a> for more on
this.</p>
