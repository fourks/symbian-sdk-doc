<h2>Introduction</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The Symbian platform supports two fundamentally different ways of
using DLLs. This underlies an important difference in the way that the types of
DLL expose their interface to the system.</p>

<h2>Frameworks, libraries, and DLLs</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Like other modern object-oriented systems, the Symbian platform
makes extensive use of frameworks. A framework is really a half-finished
software system which defines a collection of abstract base classes and
ready-made concrete classes, and which is designed for derivation. The
framework is shipped as part of the operating system in one or more system
DLLs. These DLLs are conventional static interface DLLs, which just means that
they export a table of functions which can be linked against by specifying the
import library (<code class="filename">.lib</code> file) at the link step.</p>
<p>To use the framework, a programmer derives a new implementation
from its abstract base classes, providing new behaviour where required and
making use of the default implementation otherwise. The new implementation is
then built as a DLL. However, this DLL is what's known as a polymorphic
interface DLL. Instead of exporting a table of functions which require an
import library in order to identify them correctly, a polymorphic interface DLL
exports a single function only at a well known location. Calling this function
creates an instance of the newly derived framework class. For example, a GUI
application exports the <code>NewApplication()</code> function which when
called causes a new instance of the class derived from the base application
class to be constructed.</p>
<p>Static interface DLLs are also known as shared library DLLs. As
well as providing system APIs, they also have a place in applications
programming. In a complex project, abstraction and modularisation can be
achieved by designing a system as a collection of separate units, each of which
encapsulates a piece of the logical design and provides it as a black box to
the rest of the system. Each unit is known to others only by its API, and is
built as a library DLL.</p>
<p>Even in a relatively modest application, this kind of abstraction
is encouraged. A typical application may therefore consist of one or more
shared library DLLs and the framework derived polymorphic DLL.</p>
<p>The important difference, then, between the two DLL types is in the
way they make their interface visible to the system â€” how they export their
interface. This difference in turn supports their different intended use. The
exported functions of a library DLL may be explicitly called by other code
which builds against its header files and links against its import library. In
contrast, the single exported function of a polymorphic DLL is called by the
system only, and creates an instance of a framework derived class, for example
a new instance of an application.</p>
<p>The Symbian build environment is designed to minimise the
complexity to developers of working with multiple program types. Every project
is fully specified by its project file, and makefiles are generated from
project files by the toolchain. Correctly declaring the target type in the
project file will ensure the correct build process and generate an appropriate
target.</p>
<p>Thus GUI applications are built as <code>app</code> type targets.
Static interface DLLs are built as <code>dll</code> type targets.</p>

<h2>Use of frameworks</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Frameworks are a natural extension of the programming style which
encourages memory efficient code reuse by implementing system APIs in DLLs. (In
contrast, older systems require that object code libraries be linked in
statically with every executable which uses them.) Frameworks take the notion
of an API a step further and provide both architecture and ready-made building
blocks for re-use. This makes them well suited to OO systems.</p>
<p>For most developers most of the time, therefore, working with the
Symbian platform means working with frameworks. This includes all programs
which use the Application Architecture or the UIKON GUI framework. It also
includes more specialist programming, including printer driver and device
driver implementation, as well as writing new hardware abstractions to extend
existing subsystems like comms or telephony, and implementing new protocols to
extend the networking subsystem.</p>
