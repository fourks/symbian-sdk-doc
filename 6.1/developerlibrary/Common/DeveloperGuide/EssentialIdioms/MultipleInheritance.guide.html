<h2>Overview</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Multiple inheritance is a powerful aspect of C++. Experience of
multiple inheritance indicates that its benefits are best realised by carefully
controlling the ways in which it is used within a system to a few easily
understood paradigms. Use of multiple inheritance without such control has
usually led to designs that are difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is used for a single purpose in the Symbian
platform: namely, interface protocol definitions. These are used in the
following kinds of situation: there is a <i>protocol provider</i>
class, and a <i>protocol user</i>. It is desirable that the protocol
user be independent of all aspects of the protocol provider, except its ability
to provide the specified protocol. Examples of such situations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an application control is a protocol provider; its menu tree
uses the protocol for menu observing. When a menu item has been selected, the
menu observing protocol is invoked, so that the application control may handle
the menu command. Apart from this, the menu control knows nothing about the
application control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an application, such as a spreadsheet, may have an
<i>engine</i> which provides protocols for updating and getting its
model contents, and a <i>user interface</i>, which uses these
protocols to drive the engine. The engine is written with no knowledge of the
user interface, and the user interface is written with minimal knowledge of the
engine. They interact using a protocol provided by the engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand why interfaces are used, this page examines in
turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the traditional method which uses single inheritance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a technique of overcoming the disadvantages of single
inheritance, using protocol intermediary classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a better technique, which uses multiple inheritance with
interface classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the restrictions on C++ multiple inheritance in Symbian
OS</p>

<h2>Protocols using classic single inheritance</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>A classical use of single inheritance is to define an abstract
protocol from which derived classes may inherit. A base class defines a
protocol:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CProtocol : public CBase<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode)=0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>The protocol includes just one function,
<code>HandleEvent()</code>, where the event is defined by an integer event
code.</p>
<p>A concrete protocol provider class is then derived from this base
class. It provides a concrete implementation of the pure virtual function in
the base class:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CProtocolProvider : public CProtocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// construct/destruct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static CProtocolProvider* NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void Destruct();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// implement the protocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode); // handle protocol<br>protected:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void ConstructL();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>In addition, there is a protocol user class which knows nothing
about the derived <code>CProtocolProvider</code> class, but it does know about
the <code>CProtocol</code> class and the functions that specify its protocol.
It has a function which uses <code>HandleEvent()</code>:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void CProtocolUser::DoSomething(CProtocol* aProtocol)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_LIT(KOutput1,&quot;External system doing something\n&quot;);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_LIT(KOutput2,&quot;invoking protocol - event 3\n&quot;);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testConsole.Printf(KOutput1);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testConsole.Printf(KOutput2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aProtocol-&gt;HandleEvent(3); // handle an event<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>The virtual function defined by <code>CProtocol</code> is provided
by <code>CProtocolProvider</code>. This is the virtual function that is
actually executed:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void CProtocolProvider::HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ // handle an event in the protocol user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_LIT(KOutput1,&quot;CProtocolProvider handling event %d\n&quot;);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testConsole.Printf(KOutput1,aEventCode);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>Thus, although the protocol user knows nothing about the derived
<code>CProtocolProvider</code> class, it can invoke its member functions
through a pointer to its derived class, using the C++ virtual function
mechanism.</p>
<p>This code may be used in the following way:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void doExampleL()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// show use of interface with simple class<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolProvider* provider=CProtocolProvider::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolUser* user=CProtocolUser::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user-&gt;DoSomething(provider);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // provider<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>In the function call, the <code>provider</code> pointer is cast to
its <code>CProtocol*</code> base class, as required by
<code>CProtocolUser::DoSomething()</code>.</p>
<p>The advantages of this method are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it achieves independence of the protocol user from the specific
protocol provider</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the goal we set out to achieve. However, this method has a
serious disadvantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it forces the protocol provider to be <i>derived</i>
from a protocol base class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>however, if <i>more than one</i> protocol must be
provided by the provider class, the only solution is to include all the
protocols into a single umbrella protocol, and to derive the provider class
from that. This is bad encapsulation. Firstly, the base class can become quite
large and it can be unclear why it contains so many member functions, or which
function belongs to which protocol. Secondly, it may be desirable to have
another provider class which provides some of the protocols provided by the
first class, and others in addition. To support this requires an even larger
umbrella protocol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The straightforward method of providing protocols by strict single
inheritance often leads to large base classes, representing many protocols
which should really be independent of one another.</p>

<h2>Protocols using an intermediate class</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Some of these disadvantages can be overcome by using an
intermediary object which represents the protocol, and has a pointer to the
protocol provider. The base protocol class is essentially the same:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class TProtocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode)=0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>but there is now a derived class for use with the
<code>CProtocolProvider</code> only:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class TProtocolProviderIntermediary : public TProtocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// construct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TProtocolProviderIntermediary(CProtocolProvider* aRealProvider);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// protocol itself<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode);<br>private:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolProvider* iRealProvider; // real provider<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>This class provides the protocol as far as the protocol user is
concerned. The concrete implementation of <code>HandleEvent()</code> just
passes the function call to the real protocol provider class, which has a
non-virtual <code>DoHandleEvent()</code> to provide the required
functionality:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>void TProtocolProviderIntermediary::HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iRealProvider-&gt;DoHandleEvent(aEventCode);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>With this system, <code>CProtocolProvider</code> is derived, not
from the protocol definition class, but from <code>CBase</code>:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CProtocolProvider : public CBase<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// construct/destruct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static CProtocolProvider* NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void Destruct();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// implement the protocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void DoHandleEvent(TInt aEventCode); // handle protocol<br>protected:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void ConstructL();<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TProtocolProviderIntermediary* iProviderIntermediary;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>The <code>TProtocolProviderIntermediary</code> is constructed by
the <code>CProtocolProvider</code>&#8217;s constructor, and destroyed by its
destructor. For this reason, the <code>TProtocolProviderIntermediary</code> is
a <code>T</code> class: it does not own the <code>CProtocolProvider</code>, and
cannot be orphaned.</p>
<p>When a function in the protocol user requiring the protocol
provider is called, it must now be called passing the intermediary object as a
parameter:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>LOCAL_C void doExampleL()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// show use of interface with simple class<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolProvider* provider=CProtocolProvider::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolUser* user=CProtocolUser::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user-&gt;DoSomething(provider-&gt;iProviderIntermediary);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // provider<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>The protocol user&#8217;s <code>DoSomething()</code> is
essentially as it was before, except that its parameter is now a
<code>TProtocol*</code>. Thus, the user knows only about the base
<code>TProtocol</code> class. The virtual function mechanism causes the derived
intermediary&#8217;s <code>HandleEvent()</code> to be called, and this
function passes on the request to the real protocol provider&#8217;s
<code>DoHandleEvent()</code>.</p>
<p>This method solves the problems associated with using only single
inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>any number of protocols may be supported, and separately
encapsulated, by a particular class: each protocol requires an intermediary
class, and objects of each intermediary class point to corresponding objects of
the real protocol provider class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no large base classes are needed to provide umbrellas for
several protocols</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it has a serious disadvantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is awkward: not only does each protocol require an abstract
class (which cannot be avoided), but also, at each point in the derivation tree
at which a protocol is introduced, a derived protocol class must be written
which implements the protocol for the relevant class which really provides the
protocol: further, the derived protocol object and the real protocol provider
must be linked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if there are many classes which use many protocols in this way,
not only is the method cumbersome to program, but it is uneconomical on memory,
since each derived protocol class object requires at least two machine words of
heap memory. This consideration becomes more serious if there are more small
real protocol providers, providing many different protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Protocols using interface classes</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>These problems can be overcome by using multiple inheritance. A
base <code>MProtocol</code> class specifies the protocol:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class MProtocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode)=0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>This time, however, the protocol provider is derived both from
<code>CBase</code>
<i>and</i> from <code>MProtocol</code>:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CProtocolProvider : public CBase, public MProtocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// construct/destruct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static CProtocolProvider* NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void Destruct();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// implement the protocol<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void HandleEvent(TInt aEventCode); // handle protocol<br>protected:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void ConstructL();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};</code></p>
<p>The protocol provider class provides a concrete implementation of
the <code>HandleEvent()</code> function required by the protocol. The user
class may now be invoked as follows:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>LOCAL_C void doExampleL()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// show use of interface with simple class<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolProvider* provider=CProtocolProvider::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CProtocolUser* user=CProtocolUser::NewLC();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user-&gt;DoSomething(provider);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(); // provider<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>The <code>DoSomething()</code> function requires an
<code>MProtocol*</code> parameter. C++ casts the <code>CProtocolProvider*
provider</code> pointer down to an <code>MProtocol*</code>, because
<code>MProtocol</code> is one of the base classes of
<code>CProtocolProvider</code>. When <code>DoSomething()</code> invokes
<code>HandleEvent()</code>, the C++ virtual function mechanism ensures that it
is <code>CProtocolProvider</code>&#8217;s <code>HandleEvent()</code> that is
actually called. Thus, the user may use the protocol, without knowing anything
specific about the concrete protocol provider class.</p>
<p>This method achieves the intended goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the protocol user is dependent on the protocol, but not on any
particular provider</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the protocol can be introduced into a class hierarchy at any
desired point, by multiply inheriting from a base class and one or more
interface classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>full encapsulation of different protocols is achieved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is no inconvenient intermediate class, with its
programming difficulties and wasteful memory use</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because protocols may be mixed into the derivation hierarchy of
conventional classes at any convenient point in the hierarchy, such protocol
specification classes are sometimes also called mixins, the origin of the
prefix <code>M</code>.</p>

<h2>Restrictions on the use of multiple inheritance</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The use of multiple inheritance is restricted to interfaces used as
described above. C++&#8217;s full multiple inheritance facilities are
unnecessarily complex. This is perhaps recognised by the OO community now.
Java, for instance, allows only single inheritance, but the
<code>interface</code> and <code>extends</code> keywords support the same
facilities as are provided by <code>M</code> classes. The restrictions are
given in more detail here.</p>
<p>Firstly, <code>M</code> classes primarily define protocols, not
implementations. In particular, they should not have any member data. The
restriction implies that certain types of behaviour (e.g., that of active
objects, see <a href="../../APIGuide/Base/InterProcessCommunication/AsynchronousServicesGuide/AsynchronousServicesGuide3/ActiveObjects.guide.html#AsynchronousServicesGuide3%2eactive%2dobjects">Active objects</a>) may <i>not</i> be encapsulated in an interface, but
must be derived in the conventional way.</p>
<p>Secondly, a <code>C</code> class may be derived from one other
<code>C</code> class, and zero or more <code>M</code> classes. This restriction
reflects the fact that multiple inheritance is only to be used for interfaces.
It implies that it is still possible to uniquely identify a primary inheritance
tree (the <code>C</code> class hierarchy), with interfaces as a side feature.
If arbitrary multiple inheritance were allowed, it would be impossible to
identify a primary inheritance tree. The restriction also guarantees that no
<code>C</code> class will be a multiple base class, which makes it unnecessary
to consider the complications of multiple base class inclusion, virtual
inheritance, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the <code>C</code> class must be the first specified class
in any base class list. This emphasises the primary inheritance tree and,
importantly, it makes conversions between any <code>C</code> class (including
those with interfaces) and <code>void*</code> pointers freely possible.
Admittedly, the C++ standards do not mandate that object layout follows the
order in which base classes are specified, but in practice this is the case for
most compilers, including those used for the Symbian platform.</p>
<p>Fourthly, no <code>M</code> class may be mixed in more than once in
any class, either as a direct base or as a base of any of its primary base
classes. To put it another way: when deriving a <code>C</code> class
<code>CD</code> from a base class <code>CB</code>, you may not mix in
any<code>M</code>class <code>MP</code> which has already been mixed into the
derivation of <code>CB</code>. This reflects the fact that
<code>CB</code>already supports the protocol defined by <code>MP</code>: there
is nothing to gain from mixing in this protocol class again. In addition, it
makes it unnecessary to consider the complications of multiple base class
inclusion, virtual inheritance, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, although it is legal to derive one <code>M</code> class
from another, it is not legal to include a protocol twice by including both it
and a derived protocol into a <code>C</code> class, at any point in the
<code>C</code> class&#8217;s base class graph. To put it another way, if there
is a class <code>MD</code> derived from <code>MB</code>, then a<code> C</code>
class cannot include both <code>MB</code> and <code>MD</code>. This is because
any function in the <code>C</code> class which provided an implementation of
<code>MB</code>protocol could conflict with the implementation of
<code>MD</code>protocol.</p>

<h2>Example uses</h2>

<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Callbacks</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>A special case of an interface is the callback. In this
situation, one class performs a certain function for another and, when this is
done, calls a single function in the requesting class, to indicate that the
requested operation is complete. This call-back function represents a protocol:
the requesting class is the provider, and the performing class is the user.
Apart from this, the performing class need know little or nothing about the
requesting class. This is an ideal situation for a interface.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Two-way use</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>So far, we have discussed interfaces in the context where one
class provides services according to a given protocol, and another uses those
services. In a more general case, two classes (or systems of classes) may
require services from each other, so that there is two-way interaction.</p>
<p>Services are always provided according to a protocol. The
protocol can be provided using any of the techniques described in this
document:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>conventional derivation, which is most appropriate where the
protocol characterises a class&#8217;s main purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interface inheritance, which is most appropriate where a
protocol may be a characteristic of many classes, but where these classes have
diverse main purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intermediary objects, which may be appropriate where an
interface would otherwise be used, but when multiple inheritance is disallowed,
or inconvenient for some other reason</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Observers</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>GUI applications use menus to present a user interface for
selecting options. When an option has been chosen, the menu bar should forward
a command somewhere by calling a member function of some class. The only thing
that is important to the menu bar is that some object exists which can handle
the command: beyond that, nothing matters about the object.</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CEikMenuBar ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConstructL(MEikMenuObserver* aObserver, ...);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ...<br>private:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEikMenuObserver* iObserver;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code></p>
<p>A menu bar therefore <em>uses</em> a menu observer. This is
passed in as a parameter at construction, stored as member data, and used when
an option has been selected. The menu observer interface is defined by the menu
component, as the <code>MEikMenuObserver</code> class.</p>
<p>This interface is implemented by the app UI (which also does many
other things, which are irrelevant to menus). So, <code>CEikAppUi</code>
implements menu observer interface by deriving from
<code>MEikMenuObserver</code>:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>class CEikAppUi : public CCoeAppUi, MEikMenuObserver</code></p>
<p>The app UI has a menu bar, and when it constructs the menu bar,
the app UI passes itself to the menu bar, as the observer:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>iMenuBar-&gt;ConstructL(this, ...);</code></p>
<p>C++ causes the <code>this</code> to be cast into the appropriate
base class—in this case, an
<code>MEikMenuObserver</code>—automatically.</p>
