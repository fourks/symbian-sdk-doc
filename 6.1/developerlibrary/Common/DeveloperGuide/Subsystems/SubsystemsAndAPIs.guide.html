<h1>Subsystems and APIs</h1>
</div><div class="Bodytext">

<h2>Overview</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Symbian OS is a large system, containing hundreds of
classes and thousands of member functions. Like most complex systems, it is
easiest to approach by dividing it into large areas, and gradually narrowing
your focus down to the areas that are most important to your tasks. The largest
divisions that Symbian has found useful are called <em>subsystems</em>. For
example, the Application Engines subsystem contains all the APIs that can be
used to manipulate data for the standard applications such as
<code class="ProgramName">Contacts</code>.</p>
<p>Subsystems can be thought of by third-party developers for the most
part of simply conceptual areas that group related functionality together. They
aren't binary files such as DLLs, or source files such as headers, but it's
still worth knowing about them though for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subsystems are configurable and can exist in a range of ways, some parts of a
subsystem being mandatory while others are optional. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system documentation in this Developer Library uses them
consistently to divide up functionality: look at the contents page to the API
Guide, and you'll see the subsystems listed there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation for subsystems is in turn divided up into APIs:
groups of classes identified by descriptive English names. These too don't
necessarily have a one-to-one relationship with binary libraries or headers,
though there is very often a close correspondence. This is just because the
requirements for those who need to understand and use the system are sometimes
a little different from those of the system implementers. But the detail of
libraries and headers are fully given in the API Reference
documentation.</p>
<a name="1.3.6"></a></div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Note</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext"><ul><li><p> If you have used previous versions of the
operating system, you will probably be familiar with module names such as
<code class="filename">E32</code> and <code class="filename">BAFL</code>, which derived from directory source
code names. This edition of the documentation usually avoids this type of
terminology in favour of more comprehensible English subsystem and API names.
This change may initially make the system stranger than it is. In fact, there
is a very large degree of carry over from previous releases, and, for example,
the Descriptors API that is described under Buffers and Strings as part of the
subsystem System, is much as it was when referred to as just part of the large
User library (or <code class="filename">EUSER</code>). And in particular, the use of the new
names doesn't imply that the name of the header file or the library for a class
has changed: in most cases they haven't (although neither source nor binary
compatibility is promised between this release and previous releases). We do
hope though that new users, and eventually you as well, will find the new
divisions, as consistently used throughout Symbian documentation, simpler to
use and remember.</p></li><li><p>The &quot;System&quot; subsystem, which existed in v6.0, has been split into two subsystems: &quot;Base&quot; and &quot;Graphics&quot;.</p></li></ul>

<h2>The subsystems</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>We can now look at particulars: the following figure shows the
subsystems, followed by a brief description of each:</p>
<div class="Figure">
<p class="Image"><img src="subsystems.gif" alt="Subsystems"  border="0"></p>
<p class="Caption">Subsystems</p>
<p>Note that some subsystems (Narrow Band Protocols,
Web Browser, WAP Browser) do not currently have APIs available to
third-parties. Subsystems concerned with PC connectivity are not
shown.</p>
</div>

</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Base</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The <em>Base</em> group of APIs cannot be ignored by any
developer, whatever the type of program that is being written. An important
fact to realise for the developer coming to  Symbian OS for the first
time is that certain fundamentals of programming are handled through class
libraries specifically designed and optimised for phones, rather
than through the standard C function library, or the standard C++ library (or
that part of it known as the STL). This means that the Base APIs contain the
classes that handle strings, arrays, lists, error handling, even basic types
used for integers and real numbers. As the name implies, it also contains the
APIs for genuine system programmers, who need to manipulate in detail system
fundamentals such as threads, processes, and memory.</p>
<p>A good place to start to understand the Base APIs is
<a href="../EssentialIdioms/index.html#idioms%2etoc">Essential Idioms</a>, which concentrates on the
object oriented nature of the operating system, and the surprises that it
might hold for those coming from other platforms. </p>
<a name="1.4.5"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The <em>Graphics</em> sub-component  contains the
APIs for drawing  to particular types of phones, such as the screen and printers, embedding picture objects, and font and bitmap handling. </p><p>The sub-component also contains the Window Server Client-Side API, which provides functionality to draw to windows and receive window events, and the animation APIs which allow animations to be run in a high-priority system thread.</p>
<a name="1.4.6"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Application Framework</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The <em>Application Framework</em> APIs include as their name
implies the frameworks that define the application structure and their basic
user interface handling. <em>Applications</em> here has a narrower sense
than just program: it implies a program with a user interface, rather than say,
a server program that runs in the background doing a system task. It can also
imply a whole other group of requirements such as how the documents (data) that
the application handles are presented to the user. </p>
<p>The scope of these APIs is actually a little larger than just
that, as it also includes reusable frameworks for handling such things as text
layout, user interface controls, and front end processors (non-keyboard input
mechanisms, such as hand-writing recognition).</p>
<p>The phone manufacturer adds their own specialist APIs that provide user
interface elements suitable for the screen and input mechanisms that it uses.
However, the base classes for these and many of the key application concepts
are defined by this subsystem.</p>
<a name="1.4.7"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Engines and utilities</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The <em>Application Engines</em> APIs provide access to the
application data of the core applications. This makes it straightforward for
third-party applications to be integrated with the core applications, for
example for a new communications application to store manipulate and read
<code class="ProgramName">Contacts</code> and
<code class="ProgramName">Agenda</code> data. </p>
<p>Alongside the Application Engines APIs, as specialist
manipulators of data, are the <em>Multi Media</em>
<em>Server</em>
APIs, which provides audio and image manipulation, and the <em>Application
Services</em> APIs, which provides a range of utility services to
applications, from logging and system information, to vCard and vCalendar
handling.</p>
<a name="1.4.8"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Communications</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>As you would expect from a phone
OS, there is a rich group of communications related APIs. They are
generally smaller and their use more specialist than some of the APIs we have
previously discussed.</p>
<p>The <em>Comms Infrastructure</em> APIs provides frameworks
and system services for communications and networking. It's required background
for those wishing to use particular communications technologies such as
<em>Infrared</em>, and <em>Serial Comms</em>.</p>
<p>At a higher-level, <em>Messaging</em> provides a framework
for multi-protocol messaging and support for particular messaging protocols,
and <em>Telephony</em> provides a comparable framework for telephony
services. Finally, <em>WAP Stack</em> provides access to a WAP protocol
stack.</p>
