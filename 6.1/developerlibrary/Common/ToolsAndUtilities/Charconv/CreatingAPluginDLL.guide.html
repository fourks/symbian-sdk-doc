<h2>Summary</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The following steps are involved in the process of creating a plug-in
DLL. Each step is described in more detail in following sections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create the source file. This is a text file that contains pairs of hexadecimal numbers. The first number in each pair is the encoding of a character in the foreign character set, and the second is the Unicode encoding of the same character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the control file.  This is a text file that specifies the conversion algorithms to convert both ways between ranges of characters, and other information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoke <code class="filename">cnvtool</code> on the source and control files. This
generates a cpp file referred to as the <code class="filename">cnvtool</code>-generated cpp
file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a cpp file which implements the plug-in DLL interface
(defined in <code class="filename">convplug.h</code>) using the global objects created in the
<code class="filename">cnvtool</code>-generated cpp file, if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an mmp file which is used to build the plug-in
DLL. Specify
<code class="filename">\epoc32\release\</code><i>build variant</i><code class="filename">\convplug.def</code> as the filename in the <code>deffile</code> statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the plug-in DLL and install it into the
<code class="filename">\system\charconv\</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DLL is then available to be loaded by
<code>CCnvCharacterSetConverter::PrepareToConvertToOrFromL()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> The process is summarised by the following diagram:</p>

<h2>The source file</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The source file is a text file which contains a table of mappings
between Unicode and the foreign character set. The table consists of two
tab-separated columns. The first column lists the foreign character code. The
second lists the corresponding Unicode character code. Both codes are in
hexadecimal. The table can contain further hex columns if the
<code>-columns</code> command line flag is used, (see the Running cnvtool
section, below). Another column is optional&nbsp;&#8212; it contains the
Unicode name following a comment sign &quot;#&quot;, provided to make the file more
readable.</p>
<p>In some cases, the foreign character codes that appear in the
source file need to be processed in some way before being used in the binary
output file. Specifying how they should be processed is done by including a
line in the following format in the source file:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>SET_FOREIGN_CHARACTER_CODE_PROCESSING_CODE [Perl code]</code></p>
<p>This affects all lines in the source file beneath it until the next
such line. If <code>SET_FOREIGN_CHARACTER_CODE_PROCESSING_CODE</code> is
followed by whitespace only, the foreign character codes in the subsequent
lines are not processed.</p>
<p>The Perl code must return a number using the variable
<code>$foreignCharacterCode</code> as its input parameter. For example, if the
high bit of each foreign character is off in the source file but is required to
be on in the output file, the Perl code (assuming the foreign character set
uses only one byte for each character) would be:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>return $foreignCharacterCode|0x80;</code></p>

<h2>The control file</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<a name="1.5.2"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The control file is a text file which specifies the conversion
algorithms to convert (both ways) between ranges of characters, and other
information. It also specifies the code(s) of the character(s) to use to
replace unconvertible Unicode characters, the endian-ness of the foreign
character set (if single characters may be encoded by more than one byte) and
the preferred character to use when a character has multiple equivalents in the
target character set.</p>
<p>The control file (like the source file) is case insensitive and permits
comments beginning with a &quot;#&quot; and extending to the end of the line. It also
permits blank lines and leading and trailing whitespace on non-blank
lines.</p>
<p>There are four sections in the control file: the header, the
foreign variable-byte data, the foreign-to-Unicode data and the
Unicode-to-foreign data.</p>
<a name="1.5.3"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>The header</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The header consists of two lines in fixed order. Their format is
as follows (alternatives are separated by a <code>|</code>, single space
characters represent single or multiple whitespace characters):</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>Endianness Unspecified|FixedLittleEndian|FixedBigEndian</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>ReplacementForUnconvertibleUnicodeCharacters &lt;see-below&gt;</code></p>
<p>The value of <code>Endianness</code> is only an issue for foreign
character sets where single characters may be encoded by more than one byte.
The value of <code>ReplacementForUnconvertibleUnicodeCharacters</code> is a
series of one or more hexadecimal numbers (not greater than 0xff) separated by
whitespace, each prefixed with 0x. These byte values are output for each
Unicode character that has no equivalent in the foreign character set (when
converting from Unicode to foreign).</p>
<a name="1.5.4"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>The foreign variable-byte data</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>This section is contained within the following lines:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>StartForeignVariableByteData</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>EndForeignVariableByteData</code></p>
<p>In between these lines are one or more lines, each consisting of
two hexadecimal numbers (each prefixed with 0x and not greater than 0xff),
followed by a decimal number. All three numbers are separated by whitespace.
Each of these lines indicates how many bytes make up a foreign character code
for a given range of values for the initial foreign byte. The two hexadecimal
numbers are the start and end of the range of values for the initial foreign
byte (inclusive), and the decimal number is the number of subsequent bytes. The
way these bytes are put together to make the foreign character code is
determined by the value of <code>Endianness</code> in the header of the control
file. For example, if the foreign character set uses only a single byte per
character and its first character has code 0x07 and its last character has code
0xe6, the foreign variable-byte data would be:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>StartForeignVariableByteData<br>0x07 0xe6 0<br>EndForeignVariableByteData</code></p>
<a name="1.5.5"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>The foreign-to-Unicode data</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>This section is contained within the following lines:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>StartForeignToUnicodeData</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>EndForeignToUnicodeData</code></p>
<p>In between these two lines are one or more of lines in format A
(defined below). These may be optionally followed by one or more of lines in
format B (defined below), in which case the lines in format A and format B are
separated by the line:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>ConflictResolution</code></p>
<p>Each line in format A indicates the conversion algorithm to be
used for a particular range of foreign character codes. Lines in format A
contain the following fields, each separated by whitespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>first field (reserved for future use&nbsp;&#8212; should
be set to zero),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second field (reserved for future use&nbsp;&#8212; should
be set to zero),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first input character code in the range&nbsp;&#8212; a
hexadecimal number prefixed with 0x,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>last input character code in the range&nbsp;&#8212; a
hexadecimal number prefixed with 0x,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>algorithm&nbsp;&#8212; one of <code>Direct</code> |
<code>Offset</code> | <code>IndexedTable16</code> |
<code>KeyedTable1616</code>, as described below,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parameters&nbsp;&#8212; (not applicable to any of the
current choice of algorithms)&nbsp;&#8212; set this to
<code>{}</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four possible conversion algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Direct</code>&nbsp;&#8212; this is where each character in the
range has the same encoding in Unicode as in the foreign character set,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Offset</code>&nbsp;&#8212; this is where the offset from the
foreign encoding to the Unicode encoding is the same for each character in the
range,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Indexed table (16)</code>&nbsp;&#8212; this is where a contiguous
block of foreign character codes maps onto a random collection of Unicode
character codes (the 16 refers to the fact that each Unicode character code
must use no more than 16 bits),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Keyed table (16-16)</code>&nbsp;&#8212; this is where a sparse
collection of foreign character codes map onto a random collection of Unicode
character codes (the 16 refers to the fact that each foreign character code and
each Unicode character code must use no more than 16 bits).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lines in format B, if present, consist of two hexadecimal
numbers, prefixed with 0x, separated by whitespace. The first of these is a
foreign character code which has multiple equivalents in Unicode (according to
the data in the source file), and the second is the code of the preferred
Unicode character to which the foreign character should be converted.</p>
<a name="1.5.6"></a>
</div><div class="Head3">
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>The Unicode-to-foreign data</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>This section is structured similarly to the foreign-to-Unicode
data section. It is contained within the following lines:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>StartUnicodeToForeignData</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>EndUnicodeToForeignData</code></p>
<p>In between these two lines are one or more lines in format C
(defined below). These may be optionally followed by one or more of lines in
format D (defined below), in which case the lines in format C and format D are
separated by the line:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>ConflictResolution</code></p>
<p>Format C is very similar to format A with one exception, which is
an additional field to specify the size of the output character code in bytes
(as this is a foreign character code). Each line in format C indicates the
conversion algorithm to be used for a particular range of Unicode character
codes. Lines in format C contains the following fields, each separated by
whitespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>first field (reserved for future use&nbsp;&#8212; should
be set to zero),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second field (reserved for future use&nbsp;&#8212; should
be set to zero),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first input character code in the range&nbsp;&#8212; a
hexadecimal number prefixed with 0x,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>last input character code in the range&nbsp;&#8212; a
hexadecimal number prefixed with 0x,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>algorithm&nbsp;&#8212; one of <code>Direct</code> |
<code>Offset</code> | <code>IndexedTable16</code> |
<code>KeyedTable1616</code>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>size of the output character code in bytes (not present in
format A)&nbsp;&#8212; a decimal number,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parameters - (not applicable to any of the current choice of
algorithms)&nbsp;&#8212; set this to <code>{}</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Format D is analogous to format B (described above). Like format
B, it consists of two hexadecimal numbers prefixed with 0x, separated by
whitespace. However, the first of these is a Unicode character code which has
multiple equivalents in the foreign character set (according to the data in the
source file), and the second is the code of the preferred foreign character to
which the Unicode character should be converted.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3>Generating multiple SCnvConversionData data
structures</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>It is sometimes desirable for further objects to be generated
which provide a view of a subset of the main <code>SCnvConversionData</code>
object. This is possible by inserting an extra pair of lines of the following
form in both the foreign-to-Unicode data and the Unicode-to-foreign data
sections in the control file:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>StartAdditionalSubsetTable &lt;name-of-SCnvConversionData-object&gt;</code></p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>EndAdditionalSubsetTable &lt;name-of-SCnvConversionData-object&gt;</code></p>
<p>These lines should be placed around the block of lines to be
included in the named <code>SCnvConversionData</code> object. Note that only
one pair of these lines can occur in each of the foreign-to-Unicode data and
the Unicode-to-foreign data sections, and if a pair occurs in one, it must also
occur in the other. Accessing one of these <code>SCnvConversionData</code>
objects from handwritten C++ files is done by putting a line of the following
form at the top of the relevant C++ file.</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>GLREF_D const SCnvConversionData &lt;name-of-SCnvConversionData-object&gt;;</code></p>
<p>The named object can then be used as required.</p>
<p>Using this technique means that two (or more) foreign character
sets&nbsp;&#8212; where one is a subset of the other(s)&nbsp;&#8212; can
share the same conversion data. This conversion data would need to be in a
shared-library DLL which the two (or more) plug-in DLLs would both link to.

<h3>Choosing an appropriate algorithm for a range of character
codes</h3>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>Of the four conversion algorithms listed above, the keyed table
is the most general and can be used for any foreign character set. However, it
is the algorithm requiring the most storage space, as well as being the slowest
(a binary search is required), therefore it is best avoided if possible. The
indexed table also requires storage space (although less than the keyed table),
but is much faster. The direct and offset algorithms are the fastest and
require negligible storage. It is thus necessary to choose appropriate
algorithms to minimize storage and to maximize speed of conversion.</p>
<p>Ranges of characters in the control file are permitted to
overlap. This is useful as it means that a keyed table whose range is the
entire range of the foreign character set (or the Unicode character set) can be
used at the end of the foreign-to-Unicode data (or Unicode-to-foreign data) to
&#8220;catch&#8221; all the characters that were not
&#8220;caught&#8221; by the preceding ranges, which will have used better
algorithms.</p>

<h2>Implementing the plug-in DLL interface</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The plug-in DLL interface is defined in convplug.h. The cpp file
which implements this interface should <code>#include</code>
<code class="filename">convgeneratedcpp.h</code> so that it can access the two (const) global
objects implemented in the <code class="filename">cnvtool</code>-generated cpp file. The
<code>SCnvConversionData</code> object is useful for implementing the second
and third functions of the plug-in DLL interface
(<code>ConvertFromUnicode()</code> and <code>ConvertToUnicode()</code>). This
is because the <code>CCnvCharacterSetConverter</code> class provides some
static functions taking <code>SCnvConversionData</code> parameters
(<code>DoConvertFromUnicode()</code> and <code>DoConvertToUnicode()</code>).
These utility functions make the implementation of the second and third
functions of the plug-in interface trivial for non-complex character sets.
</p>
<p>All eleven functions prototyped in convplug.h need to be
implemented by the plug-in DLL. The implementations of the reserved
functions should do nothing, i.e. have empty function bodies.</p>
<p>The implementations of <code>ConvertFromUnicode()</code> and
<code>ConvertToUnicode()</code> must fulfil the following behavioural
requirements. They must return either a negative error code (see
<code>CCnvCharacterSetConverter::TError</code>), or the number of elements at
the end of the input descriptor which have not been converted, either because
the output descriptor is full, or because there is a truncated sequence at the
end of the input descriptor, e.g. only the first half of a Unicode surrogate
pair, or only the first byte of a multi-byte foreign character set character
code, or a truncated escape sequence of a modal foreign character set. The
functions should be able to cope with the situation where the output descriptor
is too short or if there is a truncated sequence at the end of the input
descriptor, without returning an error, although if the input descriptor
consists purely of a truncated sequence, they should return
<code>CCnvCharacterSetConverter::EErrorIllFormedInput</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>CnvUtilities</code> class provides some other utility
functions which are of use for more complex foreign character sets, for
instance modal character sets. Modal character sets are those where the
interpretation of a given byte of data is dependent on the current mode, mode
changing being performed by certain defined escape sequences which occur in the
byte stream.</p>

<h2>The mmp file</h2>
</div><div class="Bodytext">
<p>The mmp file used to build the plug-in DLL should specify the
<code>targetpath</code>, <code>targettype</code>, <code>uid</code> and
<code>deffile</code> keywords as follows:</p>
<p class="CodeBlock"><code>targetpath        \system\charconv<br>targettype        dll<br>uid                0x1000601a 0x&lt;UID-in-hexadecimal&gt;<br>#if defined(WINS)<br>deffile            \epoc32\release\wins\CONVPLUG.DEF<br>#elif defined(MARM)<br>deffile            \epoc32\release\marm\CONVPLUG.DEF<br>#else<br>error<br>#endif</code></p>
<p>The second of the two UIDs (Universal Identifiers) specified in the
.mmp file must be a unique number allocated by Symbian specifically for the
required foreign character set. It should be requested in the normal way for
EPOC UIDs (by email to the Symbian Developer Network). The first UID should
always have the value 0x1000601a.</p>
